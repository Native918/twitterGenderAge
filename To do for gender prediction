To do for gender prediction
1. Count total births for a name. (per year as well as over all the years)
2. Count no of male and female births for a name.
3. Make a prediction on whether he is male or female.
4. Plot all birth frequencies per year for each name.
5. What is the probablity that given a name, the person is of age (say) 25?
	For this, you can see the mean and the variance and then figure out how to decide the age.
6. The output will be a csv file.
